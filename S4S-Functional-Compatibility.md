# S4S Functional Compatibility Analysis

## Overview

To create merged packages that are **functionally identical** to Sims 4 Studio (S4S), we need to replicate S4S's merge/unmerge behavior exactly. This goes beyond inspiration - it requires matching S4S's implementation details.

## Current Differences

### 1. Metadata Format & Storage
**S4S Approach:**
- Binary hierarchical tree structure (`MergedFolderItem` + `MergedPackageItem`)
- Stored as DBPF resource with TGI: `FNV.Hash32("S4SMergedPackageManifest")`
- Compact binary serialization (no JSON)

**Our Approach:**
- JSON-based flat structure
- Stored as DBPF resource with TGI: `0x12345678:0x87654321:0`
- Text-based serialization

**Compatibility Impact:** High - Different TGI means S4S won't recognize our packages as merged.

### 2. Deduplication Strategy
**S4S Approach:**
- TGI-based deduplication only
- Resources with identical TGIs are deduplicated
- Content similarity doesn't matter

**Our Approach:**
- Content-based deduplication
- Resources with identical content are deduplicated regardless of TGI
- More aggressive deduplication

**Compatibility Impact:** Medium - Different deduplication means different file contents.

### 3. Nested Merge Support
**S4S Approach:**
- Full nested merge support
- Can merge already-merged packages
- Hierarchical metadata tracks merge history

**Our Approach:**
- Explicitly rejects nested merges
- Flat metadata structure

**Compatibility Impact:** High - S4S users expect nested merge capability.

### 4. DBPF Structure & Compression
**S4S Approach:**
- Specific DBPF index table format
- Consistent compression settings
- Predictable resource ordering

**Our Approach:**
- Compatible DBPF format
- Same compression (Zlib)
- Different resource ordering due to content-based deduplication

**Compatibility Impact:** Low-Medium - DBPF is a standard format.

## Requirements for Functional Identity

### Phase 1: Metadata Compatibility
1. **Adopt S4S TGI**: Use `FNV.Hash32("S4SMergedPackageManifest")` instead of our custom TGI
2. **Binary Serialization**: Replace JSON with binary format matching S4S
3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Implement `MergedFolderItem`/`MergedPackageItem` tree structure
4. **S4S-Compatible Versioning**: Match S4S version numbering

### Phase 2: Deduplication Compatibility
1. **Switch to TGI Deduplication**: Only deduplicate identical TGIs, not identical content
2. **Resource Ordering**: Match S4S's resource ordering in merged packages
3. **Index Table Format**: Ensure identical DBPF index table structure

### Phase 3: Nested Merge Support
1. **Merge Detection**: Detect and handle already-merged packages
2. **Tree Merging**: Implement hierarchical metadata merging
3. **Unmerge Recursion**: Support unmerging nested merge structures

### Phase 4: Behavioral Compatibility
1. **Conditional Metadata**: Only embed manifests when necessary
2. **Error Handling**: Match S4S error messages and behaviors
3. **File Organization**: Match S4S's package structure conventions

## Implementation Complexity

### High Complexity Tasks:
- **Binary metadata format**: Reverse-engineering and implementing S4S's binary serialization
- **Nested merge logic**: Complex tree manipulation and conflict resolution
- **TGI compatibility**: Using S4S's FNV-based TGI generation

### Medium Complexity Tasks:
- **TGI deduplication**: Switching from content-based to TGI-based logic
- **Resource ordering**: Ensuring consistent ordering with S4S
- **Index table matching**: Ensuring identical DBPF structure

### Low Complexity Tasks:
- **Compression matching**: Already using Zlib like S4S
- **Basic DBPF compatibility**: Already compatible

## Ethical Considerations

### Inspiration vs. Copying
- **Acceptable**: Learning from S4S's architectural patterns (tree structures, deduplication strategies)
- **Questionable**: Directly copying TGI values, binary formats, or internal data structures
- **Problematic**: Creating packages that S4S would treat as its own

### User Experience Impact
- **Pro**: Perfect compatibility with S4S workflows
- **Con**: Loss of our superior content-based deduplication
- **Risk**: User confusion about tool origins

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Enhanced Compatibility Mode
- Add a "S4S-compatible" mode that produces S4S-identical packages
- Keep our advanced features as default
- Allow users to choose compatibility vs. features

### Option 2: Interoperability Layer
- Create a translation layer between our format and S4S format
- Allow importing/exporting between formats
- Maintain our superior internal format

### Option 3: Selective Compatibility
- Match S4S behavior for core operations
- Keep our improvements where they don't break compatibility
- Focus on functional equivalence rather than binary identity

## Recommended Path Forward

1. **Start with TGI Compatibility**: Use S4S's TGI for metadata resources
2. **Implement Nested Merges**: Add hierarchical metadata support
3. **Add Compatibility Mode**: Create S4S-compatible output option
4. **Preserve Our Advantages**: Keep content-based deduplication as a premium feature

## Success Criteria

**Functional Identity Achieved When:**
- S4S can successfully unmerge our packages
- Our tool can handle S4S merged packages
- Nested merges work identically
- Package contents are equivalent (accounting for deduplication differences)

**Binary Identity Achieved When:**
- Hex dumps of packages are identical
- S4S treats our packages as its own
- No detectable differences in file structure
